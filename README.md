This is a Bitcoin payment plugin for PrestaShop using BTCPay server. [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org) is a free and open source server for merchants wanting to accept Bitcoin for their business.

**Warning**: This version should be considered as beta. Use it at your own risk.

## Tested successfully
* Prestashop 1.7.7.x
* BTCPay server v1.0.6.4

**Note**: The legacy version can be found at [prestashop-plugin-legacy](https://github.com/btcpayserver/prestashop-plugin-legacy) and will not recieve any further support at this time.

That said, this module has `v4` as it's module version and includes migration scripts to try and migrate your old module to this new version. The module name has been kept as is, so upgrading should be easy.

## Internals

This plugin support creating orders before or after payment. That said the `before`-mode still requires a callback from the BTCPay server itself so that all relevant data is available during order creation.

## Future improvements
There is a lot of improvements that can still be made:
* Create a docker container for testing
* Rewrite to use the new [Greenfield Invoice API](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/API/Greenfield/v1/).
