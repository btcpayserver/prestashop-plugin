        ### ❗️ Read this before submitting your bug report:
        - **Provide as much detail as possible** - error logs, screenshots, your exact configuration. If the issue cannot be reproduced, it cannot be fixed.
        - **Avoid reporting "error 500" or "white page" errors** - this is a universal error message that does not provide enough information to qualify the issue. Enable debug mode in the Performance section of PrestaShop or manually in `/config/defines.inc.php` and try again. You should get a proper error message.
        - Thank you for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
